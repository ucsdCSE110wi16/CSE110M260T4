This is how you put a new ingredient(beef) in the "Ingredients" column that we already created on Parse.
Put that in the main activity in the method onCreate()

Parse.initialize(this);
        ParseObject testObject = new ParseObject("Ingredients");
        testObject.put("Name", "beef");
        testObject.saveInBackground();
